/**
 * The live side of connected computers (ADR 0025): one WebSocket per machine,
 * held by whichever replica the runner reached. Socket-agnostic (the server
 * adapts Bun's WebSocket to `MachineSocket`; tests use an in-memory one).
 *
 * - `hello` → token checked → `welcome`; the row gets `online`, this
 *   replica's id and the runner's info. A second socket for the same machine
 *   replaces the first (`refused: replaced`).
 * - `ping` every heartbeat; `last_seen_at` is written at most every
 *   40 s on `pong`, so a row is never stale while its socket lives.
 * - `call` sends a `request` and resolves on its `result`, forwarding
 *   `output`; aborting sends `cancel`. A machine held by another replica is
 *   reached through a `machine_rpc` row plus a pub/sub signal both ways.
 * - Brain turns (protocol 8, ADR 0032): `brain.turn` is a request like any
 *   other; its `brain.event` / `brain.done` frames are published on
 *   `brainTopic(runId)` (with the machine id) for the replica running the turn.
 * - Background tasks (protocol 4, `machine-tasks.ts`): this replica persists
 *   the `task.event` and `task.done` frames of the sockets it holds and acks
 *   each `task.done`; `hello` reconciles the runner's journal; a socket that
 *   closes schedules `machine.tasks_offline` after a grace.
 * - Desktop app (protocols 9 and 10, ADR 0036): the pause (`hello.paused`,
 *   `runner.state`) and the access report (`hello.access`, `access.changed`)
 *   are stored on the row and told to the org; a paused machine gets no new
 *   work (`call` refuses with `MachinePausedError`); every request's `agent`
 *   carries the agent's name; the `agents` frame goes out after `welcome`
 *   and again on `machine.agents` (any replica); `access.decided` wakes the
 *   agent that asked (`machine-access.ts`).
