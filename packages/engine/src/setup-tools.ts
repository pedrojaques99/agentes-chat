"Ask a person to change a setting of your own, with one card in this conversation: turn on or off a skill installed here, join or leave a channel or how you answer there, your model, the AI account you think with, your monthly budget, your owner, who may talk to you, your name, your look or who you report to. Use it whenever a request needs a setting of yours you don't have, instead of telling the person how to change it by hand or saying you can't ask. Nothing changes until a person clicks, even when the person who asked could change it: the card waits for whoever may (they send one they can't decide from there), and the result says which. Apps and permissions: request_permission. A skill not installed yet: offer_install_skill."

A change the person who asked may make, with nothing read from outside this turn, applies at once with Undo. Any other waits on the card for who may make it, and one they can't make they send from there. The result says which: never say it is done before it does.
