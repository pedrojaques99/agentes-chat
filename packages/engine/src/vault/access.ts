/**
 * Who may see, manage and use a Vault item (ADR 0144). One place for every check: the app's (people) and the
 * tools' (agents). Items are few per workspace, so callers load them (`VAULT_MAX_ITEMS`) and filter here in code.
 *
 * People:
 * - A personal item or connection is its owner's alone: they see, edit and delete it. Admins don't see
 *   anyone else's.
 * - A team item is seen by whoever manages credentials (`manage_credentials`) and by its audience (everyone, its
 *   roles, its people). Only those who manage credentials edit or delete it, and only they see and change
 *   team connections.
 *
 * Agents: the person behind the run (the one who asked, else a routine's creator, else nobody), counted only while
 * an active member; for the team's right hand, only in that person's own DM with it.
 * - Every item: the agent is one it is shared with (`allAgents`, or in `agentIds`).
 * - Personal: that person is its owner.
 * - Team: that person is in its audience, or nobody is behind the run and it is shared with everyone.
