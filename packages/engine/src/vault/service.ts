/**
 * The Vault (ADR 0144): logins, keys and contacts a workspace keeps for its agents. This file holds what the rest of
 * the engine and the API see: the dependencies, the shapes people and agents get, and the inputs they send. The
 * shapes match `packages/client/src/vault/types.ts`, so a route hands them over as they are.
 *
 * A value (a password, a key) never appears in any of these shapes, nor in any answer to a person once it is saved
 * (§2): agents get one only through `releaseVaultLogin`/`releaseVaultKeys`, on their way into a box sealed for their
 * own computer.
