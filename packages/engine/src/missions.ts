 * session is the agent's run in the home thread with the mission's brain (the
 * API model, Claude Code or Codex; ADR 0032 §6, missions-engine.ts): it plans
 * the mission, hears what people send and splits the work into item tasks on
 * the connected computer; our side shows, stores, asks for approval and
 * delivers, with code and no model.
 *
 * - One mission per thread (its home). Seeing is inherited from the home;
 *   acting (work on the machine, decisions, reviews, controls) is the
 *   owner's and the `decide` participants'. `comment` participants give
 *   opinions on decisions; everyone else is read only, and their messages to
 *   the agent there become suggestions (decided in the message insert).
 * - Talking to the main session = a notice in the home thread that starts
 *   (or joins) its run. Talking to an item session = resuming it on the
 *   machine (`claude -p --resume`) as a new machine task. A session that
 *   can't hear now (an item's task still runs, a paused mission, an offline
 *   computer) gets the text in `missions.inbox` later.
 * - `.agentes/` files (mission.md, decisions.md) are written to the machine
 *   after every change (debounced job `mission.sync_files`); notes.md is read
 *   back after each mission task.
