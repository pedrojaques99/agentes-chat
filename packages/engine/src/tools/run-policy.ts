/**
 * What a run may do with each tool, by who is behind it (ADR 0053 §2 and its addendum of 2026-10-31). One
 * table for every brain: the Tool Gateway applies it when listing (a refused tool isn't listed, for the
 * model loop and for the bridge Claude Code and Codex reach our tools through) and again on every call,
 * and it turns `approve` into an approval card whatever the agent's own settings say.
 *
 * - `person` and `unattended` (nobody behind it: it works as the agent itself): every tool but
 *   `hand_off`; scopes and the tools' own approvals decide. A tool that needs a person's request
 *   refuses on its own when nobody is behind the run.
 * - `unattended` that a routine's report or work woke (`fedByRoutine`): what the routine read (inbound mail, a
 *   webhook) feeds it, so it keeps the routine's bounds (below), plus the reply where it is (`here`), never
 *   `hand_off` nor a mission's tools; every write to a connected app asks a person.
 * - `routine`: nothing that speaks for someone (reactions, GIFs and stickers, questions, reminders,
 *   routines, events, channels, secrets, permissions). It reports through `hand_off`, whose message may carry a GIF
 *   (its `gif`, as `post_message`'s, ADR 0091 addendum 2026-11-09). Otherwise it
 *   works as the agent (ADR 0109: one permission model, the agent's own): reads, the web and the browser,
 *   internal changes people can undo (issues, memory, wiki, Drive, Vault contacts, its own branches and pull
 *   requests, its computer); every write to a connected app asks a person, except the actions its creator allowed for its job
 *   (`routines.own_actions`: the gateway lets those through, `ownJobCovers`). It reaches other agents (`ask_agent`,
 *   `tell_agent`) and posts where its creator can post (`post_message`, `send_dm` to its creator): the
 *   tools hold it to its creator's rooms and agents (ADR 0053 §2, amended 2026-10-31).
 * - `routine` redoing a widget (its brief's `widget`, ADR 0135 §5): it only reads (built-in reads, connected apps'
 *   reads, the web, the browser) and answers through `update_widget`; everything else is refused with why,
 *   `hand_off` included: a widget's refresh never posts. `update_widget` is no other run's. What it starts with in
 *   hand, where a brain's harness would hold tools back behind a search: `widgetUpFront`.
 *
 * The agent's own approvals level (ADR 0173, amended 2026-11-12) moves every run. At `always` every call that changes
 * something answers `approve` (`asksAtAlways`): a connected app's write, an internal change, what speaks elsewhere, a
 * tool this table doesn't know, on a person's run, the agent's own, a routine's and one a routine's reading feeds.
 * At `never` nothing asks: this table still answers `approve` for a routine's write to a connected app, and the
 * gateway lifts every card there (`unaskedAtNever`), so a refusal here is never lifted with it.
 *
 * Tool names are written here as plain strings (not imported) so the table loads before the tool
 * modules, which import the gateway.
