 * one way such a run speaks. Its message is posted where the routine reports, or with `wake_me`
 * becomes a `routine_handoff` notice there (`deliverRoutineReport`), at once and once per run (a second call is refused),
 * after checking the routine may still speak there (`routineDeliveryBlock`); when it can't, the
 * routine run is skipped with the reason and the model is told to finish. Where the agent may send GIFs
 * (`AgentGifPoster.offered`), it takes `gif`: the message goes with a GIF (ADR 0091 addendum 2026-11-09).
