 * waits on its person (`proposeDashboardAudience`); narrowing applies at once. A widget's refresh run lists only
 * `update_widget`, its one way to speak.
 *
 * - `list_dashboards`: the boards the person behind the run edits (and their home), with their widgets' titles.
 * - `create_dashboard` `{ title, about?, audience?, roles?, why?, edit?, edit_roles? }`: a board for the person behind
 *   the run (else the accountable person), private; a wider `audience` becomes a proposal to them.
 * - `create_widget` `{ dashboard_id?, title, prompt, kind?, schedule, alert?, size?, data?, sources? }`: on a board
 *   that person edits (default: their home); `data` (a `WidgetSpec`) shows at once, else the first build is queued.
 * - `share_dashboard` `{ dashboard_id, audience?, roles?, why?, edit?, edit_roles? }`: narrower applies (on a board
 *   the agent made or the person manages), wider is a proposal; a routine's or unattended run only ever proposes.
 *   Who edits (`edit`, `edit_roles`) applies at once: editing isn't seeing (ADR 0135 §8).
 * - `update_widget` `{ data?, summary, sources?, title?, prompt?, alert?, failed? }`: listed only on a widget's refresh
