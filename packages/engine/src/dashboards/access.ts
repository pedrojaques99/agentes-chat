 * Who sees, edits and manages a board (ADR 0135 §8).

 *   `roles` when the viewer holds one of `audience_role_ids` at the time (`organization_member_roles`, as
 *   `channelAudienceSql`) or is an admin. A `private` board and a `home` board are their owner's alone, admins
 *   included. A `roles` board with no role left is its owner's (and admins') alone.
 * - **Edits** (title, about, widgets, layout, refresh, change requests): its owner and admins, and who sees it when
 *   `edit_policy` is `viewers`, or who sees it and holds one of `edit_role_ids` at the time when it is `roles` (seeing
 *   comes first: an edit role whose holders don't see the board gives them nothing). A home board: its owner only.
 * - **Manages** (share, delete, pin): its owner and admins; never for a home board but by its owner (no share or
 *   delete at all for a home board).
 * - **Admin**: `can(membership, "administrator")` (owners hold it too).
 * - **Shows to others** (`audience` other than `private` on create or share): needs `post`.
