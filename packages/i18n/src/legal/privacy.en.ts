            "**Between devices and our servers.** Everything sent between our servers and the browsers, apps and computers that connect to them, Workspace Content included, passes through our network provider, which protects the Service from attacks. To do that, the network provider decrypts this traffic at its data center nearest to each device, and handles it on our behalf.",
            "**Answering.** When an agent works, it sends the context it needs (the workspace's context, the agent's instructions, the conversation, relevant memory and the results of its tools) to the model provider chosen for that agent. With an API key the workspace added, the call is made under the workspace's own account and agreement with that provider. With an AI plan, such as Claude or ChatGPT, connected to an agent, the agent works under the account of the person who connected the plan and under the provider's terms.",
            "**Deciding who replies.** A routing model reads a new message, the names and roles of the workspace's agents, and recent conversation to decide which agent, if any, should reply. It runs at TypeSafe or, as a fallback, at the workspace's model provider. Routing never grants an agent any permission.",
            "**Memory.** Agents keep memory from conversations (summaries, facts and lessons) so they improve over time. Some judgments about memory (whether something is worth keeping, or conflicts with what an agent already knows) are made by TypeSafe. Memory can be seen and removed in the agent's page, and it is deleted with the workspace.",
            "**Search.** To find related messages and documents, text may be turned into vectors (embeddings) by Voyage AI.",
            "**Connectors.** When the workspace connects a service (such as GitHub, Google, Linear, Sentry, an email inbox or any MCP server), we store its access tokens encrypted and read or write that service only within the scopes the workspace gave each agent. The connected service processes that data under its own terms. Connections to Gmail and Outlook inboxes, and to Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Slack, Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, HubSpot, Salesforce, Zendesk, Asana, Figma, Intercom, Dropbox, Square, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, Reddit and WhatsApp, go through Composio, which processes what agents read and write there.",
            "**Databases.** Database connections are read-only. Credentials are stored encrypted and each query is checked before it runs.",
            "**Connected computers.** When someone connects a computer, agents can run commands and use a browser there, within the folders and permissions set on that computer. The live view of an agent's browser passes through our network provider and through our servers' memory, and is not recorded. A summary of the steps the agent took (such as addresses visited and actions) is kept with its work so the team can see what it did.",
            "**The workspace's computer.** On agentes.chat Cloud, a workspace's agents work on a computer we run for that workspace, on our servers or a hosting provider's, in the European Union or the United States. We count how much data each agent's browser, AI tools and other programs send and receive there, per day.
