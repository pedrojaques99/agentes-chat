/**
 * Deterministic command policy for computer turns (ADR 0029, ADR 0053 §3). No
 * model: plain parsing of the call Claude Code (or Codex) wants to make. The
 * runner's permission prompt, Codex's command approvals and the server's
 * `permission_prompt` all decide with these functions, so every brain follows
 * the same rules.
 *
 * - `deniedInMissions` / `deniedMessage`: the deny list (merges, deploys,
 *   rollbacks, publishing, `gh api`, printed tokens), matched on normalized
 *   arguments (`gh -R`, `git -C/-c`): refused at once with the kind it is,
 *   never asked.
 * - `loneMerge`: the one merge the computer may run without a person, for a
 *   repository the agent's owner chose (`mergeRepos`).
 * - `gitPushes` / `heldPush` / `approvalNeeded`: where each push goes, read
 *   with git on the computer (the remote's default branch, the protected
 *   ones, the agent's own): a push to the default branch, a force push to
 *   someone else's branch or a deletion waits for a person; any other push is
 *   ordinary work. Through our git proxy the server decides those instead,
 *   so they never run from here and the refusal says where to go
 *   (`delete_branches`, a pull request). Every path that runs a command on
 *   the computer (the brain's own commands, `run_code`, skill scripts,
 *   background tasks) asks `approvalNeeded` first.
 * - `secretRead`: a call that reads keys, tokens or env files, with any read
 *   tool (Read, Glob, Grep, a shell command): refused at once too. Only calls
 *   that reach a prompt are seen: Claude Code's own reads meet the same list
 *   as deny rules (`SECRET_READ_DENY_RULES`); Codex runs the commands it deems
 *   safe (`cat`, `grep`…) without asking, so there secrets are kept from
 *   leaving rather than from being read (ADR 0053 §3).
 * - `readOnlyCall`: harmless reads (listing and reading files anywhere but
 *   secrets, read-only git, GET/HEAD fetches that save only into the
 *   mission folder; in the `plan` profile no fetch and no write at all). The
 *   runner's prompt tool allows these at once, with no card and nothing posted.
 * - `forbiddenReason`: what code never lets the judge approve (sudo, deletes
 *   and writes outside the mission folder, system services, uploads, remote
 *   shells, global installs, inline code, anything it can't read plainly).
 *   The judge only classifies what is left; the deny list stays first and hard.
 * - `localVerdict`: the part the computer decides by itself (the rest goes to
 *   the server, which may ask a person).
 *
 * Anything this can't parse with certainty is "not read-only" (a card).
