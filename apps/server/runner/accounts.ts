/**
 * The computer brains' accounts on this machine (ADR 0041). An account is a
 * folder `<runner home>/accounts/<kind>/<id>` (mode 700) used as
 * `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (Claude Code) or `CODEX_HOME` (Codex): the CLI signs
 * in there and keeps its own sign-in; the runner never reads it.
 *
 * - `begin` starts the CLI's own sign-in with plain pipes (`claude auth login`,
 *   `codex login --device-auth`) in a new folder and reads what it printed:
 *   Claude Code's URL (plus an ephemeral key the browser seals the pasted code
 *   with), or Codex's device URL and one-time code.
 * - `code` opens the sealed Claude code and writes it to the waiting CLI.
 * - When the CLI exits, its status command (`claude auth status --json`,
 *   `codex login status`) in that folder decides: `done` with the email and
 *   plan (a Claude Max's tier from the CLI's `.claude.json` there tells Ultra
 *   apart, `claudePlan`), or `failed` (folder removed). After
 *   `ACCOUNT_LOGIN_TTL_MS` the sign-in is killed and its folder removed
 *   (`expired`).
 * - `list` asks each account's CLI (cached for `ACCOUNTS_TTL_MS`), but one a
 *   turn's endpoint refused reads as signed out until it signs in again
 *   (`refused`); `remove` signs out (best effort) and deletes the folder,
 *   `accountDir` is what a brain turn runs with.
 * - Usage (protocol 19, `plan-usage.ts`): what the turns say comes in through
 *   `noteRateLimit` / `noteCodexRateLimits`, and `probeUsage` looks it up on
 *   demand; the list carries it, and the computer's own sign-ins' is `ownUsage`.
 * - Key accounts (protocol 20): a coding plan on Claude Code. `begin` with a
 *   `provider` makes the folder and the key pair only, `code` opens the plan's
 *   key and keeps it in `provider.json` (600); no CLI ever signs in or out
 *   there. It is signed in until a turn's endpoint refuses the key.
 * - System mode (`lending`): a folder belongs to the OS user of the agent
 *   that thinks with it, only while it does (`lendTo`, `keepLent`), else to
 *   root. Root never runs a CLI against what an agent's user could write: such
 *   a folder's status is what its turns said and its plan what Claude Code
 *   keeps there (`claudeKeptPlan`), signing in again starts it over, and
 *   removing it signs nothing out.
 * - Protocol 29, one sign-in for all of its owner's agents: every folder
 *   where the agents are the runner's own user (the CLIs keep one sign-in for
 *   several processes of one user). In system mode, a sign-in made `shared`
 *   (`<id>.shared` beside its folder) is root's alone and never lent: a
 *   Claude one is `claude setup-token`'s token (`token.json`, 600), signed in
 *   in a terminal of its own (`spawnInTerminal`), a coding plan's is its key, a
 *   ChatGPT or Gemini one is its CLI's own sign-in there, and `grant` hands what
 *   a turn needs to the agent's worker (protocol 58: a copy of Gemini's, tried
 *   once as the sign-in ends, `agyCopyFails`).
 * - Claude's own login for all agents (`sharedLogin`; `<id>.method` says
 *   `cli_shared`, read as `cli_login` by everything outside this file): the
 *   folder here stays root's and empty; the CLI's store is the sign-in's OS
 *   user's (`AccountUsers`), and sign-in, status, usage and sign-out run as
 *   that user. Root never opens anything in that store.
