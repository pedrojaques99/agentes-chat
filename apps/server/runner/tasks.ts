/**
 * Background tasks (protocol 4, ADR 0029): commands that outlive a request,
 * the socket and the runner itself.
 *
 * - Each task runs under a tiny wrapper (`wrap.mjs`, plain JavaScript run by
 *   this same runtime) started detached in its own process group and
 *   `unref()`ed, so restarting the runner (an update, a crash) leaves it
 *   running. The wrapper starts the command with stdout/stderr going to
 *   `<runner home>/tasks/<taskId>/stdout.log` and `stderr.log`, touches
 *   `alive` every 15 s, enforces `maxSeconds`, stops on `cancel` (a file, so
 *   it works on Windows too; a SIGTERM from outside, as at a shutdown, ends it
 *   as interrupted), and writes `exit.json` (atomically) when the command
 *   ends. A pid alone can't tell "still running" after a reboot (pids are
 *   reused); a fresh `alive` can.
 * - The journal `<runner home>/tasks/journal.json` (written whole, then
 *   renamed) lists every task with its state; `hello` carries it.
 * - A watcher tails the logs: Claude Code's `stream-json` lines become a
 *   human last line and the files it edits; other executors send their last
 *   plain lines. Events are throttled and secrets redacted (ADR 0027).
 *   A pull request URL seen in the output (`gh pr create`, a tool result)
 *   goes once as `task.event` `prUrl` (protocol 6).
 * - `task.output` (protocol 6) re-reads the end of a task's log and answers
 *   the same human lines the watcher derives ("Ver saída"), redacted.
 * - `task.done` goes once per task and again after each reconnect until the
 *   server acknowledges it (`task.ack`).
 * - Claude Code and Codex sign in as the agent's turns do (protocol 31, ADR
 *   0041 §5.1): with `account`, that account's folder is the CLI's home, a
 *   plan's key goes in its env, and a token root keeps reaches the wrapper on
 *   its descriptor 3 and the CLI on its own, never a file or an environment.
 *   Without `account`, the computer's own sign-in. A CLI that found nothing to
 *   sign in with ends with what its agent can do instead (`noSignInResult`).
 * - A Claude sign-in several agents share (`AccountGrant` `hosted`): its CLI is root's and no wrapper runs here. All the
 *   rest stays with this manager: root hears where the task runs (`HostedTask`) and sends the CLI's lines back into the
 *   same logs, then how it ended into `exit.json`, so the watcher reads it like any other. Such a CLI dies with the
 *   runner, so the task ends as interrupted then, for the server to resume.
