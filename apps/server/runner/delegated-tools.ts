/**
 * Claude Code's own tools, served by the agent's worker, for a sign-in shared by several agents. The CLI holding the
 * sign-in runs with none of its tools that touch files or run code, as a user no agent code runs as; these take their
 * place on the `agentes` bridge, so each call runs as the agent's own user, in its mount view, network and slice. Only
 * a turn with the delegated profile gets them (`McpTaskInfo.delegated`).
 *
 * Names, parameters, limits and answers copy Claude Code's, read from its 2.1.3xx binary: the model knows those
 * tools and is trained on what they say. Every call meets what the native tools met: the turn's settings rules
 * (`claudePermissionSettings`) that Claude Code would check, then our prompt tool (`permissionPrompt`).
 *
 * A command's output goes straight to a file, never through this process: a call moved to the background keeps
 * running with nothing to hand over, a dev server outlives the turn and the CLI, and output past the inline limit is
 * already where `Read` can page it.
