/**
 * Brain turns (protocol 8, ADR 0032): Claude Code thinks for an agent on
 * this machine, one conversational turn at a time.
 *
 * - Each turn runs `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format
 *   stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages`, with `--resume <session>`
 *   (or `--session-id` for a new one), the agent's model (`--fallback-model
 *   sonnet` under opus), the engine's context appended to the system prompt
 *   from a file (no shell, no quoting: the process is spawned with an argv),
 *   our MCP bridge (`--mcp-config`, `--strict-mcp-config` unless the agent
 *   opted into the owner's own servers) and the turn's permission profile
 *   (`brainProfileLaunch`: `--settings`, the permission prompt tool, the deny
 *   list; a `plan` turn reads only, ADR 0053 §3). A background turn
 *   (`keepAlive: false`) leaves no process behind.
 * - The turn's prompt goes in as a stream-json user message on stdin. Output
 *   lines become `WireBrainEvent`s: text deltas (batched every ~50 ms), tool
 *   calls with their results (already executed: our tools through the bridge,
 *   Claude Code's own on the machine), plan usage, plan limits, and a final
 *   `done` or `error`.
 * - Block 5: one process per (agent, session) stays alive between turns
 *   (stdin open), closed after `idleMs` without a turn, at most
 *   `maxProcesses` kept per agent (the least recently used idle one of that
 *   agent's is closed for a new one). With all busy, a turn still gets its
 *   own process (live messages reach it too), and the cap is restored as
 *   turns end, least recently used idle first. A process that holds the agent's work (a task in the
 *   background such as a dev server, or a turn of its own) is never closed as
 *   idle, to make room, or for the cap: closing it would kill that work.
 *   `reclaimIdle` closes one when the computer is short of memory for a turn
 *   (any agent's, the least recently used; the waiting turn's own session
 *   last).
 *   A process that dies while idle is started again (resumed) on the next
 *   turn; one that dies mid-turn is replaced by a one-shot resume of the same
 *   turn. Turns of one session run one at a time (queued).
 * - ADR 0041: a turn with an `account` runs with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set to
 *   that account's folder (its sessions live there too; a missing folder is
 *   `account_missing`, never another account), and `effort` is `--effort`.
 *   A change of either starts the process again. Where requests go is pinned
 *   in the runner's own `--settings` (`accountSettingsEnv`), which outranks
 *   the project's settings the agent can write. A key account (protocol 20)
 *   thinks through its plan's endpoint: its key in the process env (never in
 *   a file the CLI reads, and redacted from everything sent), its model
 *   aliases mapped to the plan's models, no fallback model. `--model` is the
 *   agent's alias, or one of the plan's models by id (`claudeCodeModel`).
 * - Protocol 15 (live steering): `steer` writes messages into the turn in
 *   progress as stream-json user lines (each with its `uuid`); Claude Code
 *   reads them at its next tool boundary (`priority: "next"`; "now" for an
 *   urgent one where the CLI can move the running tool to the background).
 *   Support is what the CLI's `system/init` `capabilities` say, not its
 *   version (`steerSupport`). A message is read when its `command_lifecycle`
 *   says `started` (`steer_read` at once); the result's `user_message_uuids`
 *   confirm the same (deduplicated). One it hadn't read when the turn ended
 *   starts the CLI's next turn: this request waits for that turn too and the
 *   answers join, so nothing runs unheard.
 * - Work moved to the background mid-turn (an urgent message) goes on after
 *   the turn's `result`, and when it ends Claude Code starts another turn by
 *   itself: the request stays open for it (bounded) and the answers join.
 *   Past the bound the request ends and the process is left draining.
 * - A turn the CLI runs by itself while no request listens (a background task
 *   of the agent's own that ended later, or moved work past the bound): its
 *   output goes nowhere. The next request waits for that turn's `result`
 *   (`STRAY_TURN_WAIT_MS`) and then uses the same process, so the agent's
 *   other background jobs (a dev server, a watcher) live on. Only a turn stuck
 *   past that wait has its process killed (the next one resumes the session).
 * - A sign-in several agents share (`BrainTurnContext.delegated`, `account-brains.ts`): this manager runs in root and
 *   the CLI as the sign-in's own user. Its tools are the agent's worker's (`delegated-tools.ts`), root alone writes its
 *   stdin, and nothing of the agent's is opened here: the worker says what the turn's folder holds.
