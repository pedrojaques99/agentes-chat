 * The app's Expo config. Builds: the "Android build" and "iOS build" workflows on GitHub Actions, or EAS (see
 * README.md). The native projects are made from this file by `expo prebuild` and never committed.
 * - `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`: the server the app talks to by default (production); people can pick their own.
 * - `EAS_PROJECT_ID`: overrides the EAS project (the iPhone's Expo push tokens need it); defaults to ours on expo.dev.
 * - `APP_VARIANT`: "development" | "preview" | "production" (from eas.json or the workflow), so the three install
 *   side by side.
 * - `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`: path to Firebase's google-services.json, for push on Android (FCM).
 * - `ANDROID_VERSION_CODE`: the build's version code, set by the Android workflow (EAS numbers its own builds).
 * - `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: the Apple team that signs the iOS app and its share extension (a build setting, never in the
 *   repo).
 * - `IOS_BUILD_NUMBER`: the build's number on iOS, set by the iOS workflow.
 *
 * The New Architecture is the only one since SDK 55, so there is no `newArchEnabled` flag any more
 * (the SDK 58 config type no longer has it). Edge-to-edge on Android is likewise always on.
