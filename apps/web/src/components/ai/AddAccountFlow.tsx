/*
 * "Add account" (ADR 0041 §2, ADR 0059): the computer starts the
 * provider's own sign-in and its link opens here, in a window of its own: the
 * account chosen there is the one connected. Claude: the code Claude shows
 * goes to the computer by itself as soon as it lands in the field ("Paste",
 * a paste, typed or dropped) when it is this sign-in's; anything else waits
 * for "Send", with a line under it. Either way it is sealed here to the
 * computer's key. ChatGPT: device code sign-in allowed in its settings first,
 * then the device page and the one-time code to type there. A coding plan:
 * its own key page, then the key, sealed the same way; it never reaches our
 * server. Cursor (ADR 0114): its sign-in page, and the computer finishes by
 * itself; or, chosen under it, a Cursor API key, sent like a plan's key. Gemini (ADR 0143): Google's sign-in page,
 * then the code it shows, pasted like Claude's (its page's address, which carries no code, is never sent); a
 * personal Google account under the plain warning about Google's
 * terms, or (chosen under it) Gemini Enterprise. "Paste" shows only while the field is empty. Every start is a click,
 * never the block showing. The page asks every 2 s; Back or closing stops
 * the sign-in on the computer. "Copy link" beside a sign-in's button copies
 * its link instead, to open in another browser or profile (it begins the
 * sign-in when it hasn't yet). Reads that fail while the server restarts or
 * the computer reconnects say Reconnecting, and the same sign-in goes on
 * (`loginRead`). One key can go to several logins at once (`fanOut`): each is
 * begun, sealed to and watched on its own.
